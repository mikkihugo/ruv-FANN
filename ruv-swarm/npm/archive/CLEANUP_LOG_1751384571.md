## Date: 2025-07-01
## Agent: Cleanup Specialist (doc-swarm-1751384571)

### Actions Taken:

1. **Created Archive Structure**
   - Created `archive/` folder with subdirectories: config, old-tests, reports

2. **Consolidated Test Folders**
   - Moved `tests/__mocks__` → `test/__mocks__`
   - Moved `tests/setup.ts` → `test/setup.ts`
   - Moved `tests/utils.test.ts` → `test/unit/utils.test.ts`
   - Removed empty `tests/` folder

3. **Organized Documentation**
   - Created `docs/implementation/` folder
   - Moved `TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` → `docs/implementation/`

4. **Updated .gitignore**
   - Added `archive/` to ignored paths

### Current Folder Structure:
```
npm/
├── archive/          # Backup and old files
├── bin/              # Executable scripts
├── config/           # All configuration files
├── data/             # Database files
├── dist/             # Build output
├── docs/             # Documentation
├── examples/         # Usage examples
├── scripts/          # Utility scripts
├── src/              # Source code
├── test/             # All tests (consolidated)
├── test-reports/     # Test execution reports
└── wasm/             # WebAssembly files
```

### Notes:
- Configuration files at root (jest.config.js, tsconfig.json) are symlinks to config/ folder
- bin/archive/ already contains old versions of CLI files
- All test-related files are now consolidated in test/ folder
- Documentation is properly organized in docs/ with subdirectories

| **What happened**                    | A team of nine mathematicians led by Dennis Gaitsgory (Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, Bonn) and Sam Raskin (Yale) unveiled a proof of the *geometric Langlands conjecture*.  The conjecture is a central part of the Langlands programme, a network of conjectures connecting number theory and harmonic analysis.  This “grand unified theory” of mathematics had been pursued for decades; the new proof spans five papers totalling nearly 1,000 pages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Recognition**                      | The impact of the proof was quickly acknowledged.  In April 2025 Gaitsgory received the US\$3‑million Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics, and Raskin won a New Horizons prize.  Mathematicians describe the work as a “huge triumph” that opens new research paths rather than closing them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **What is the Langlands programme?** | The original programme, proposed by Robert Langlands in the late 1960s, seeks deep connections between two major areas: number theory and harmonic analysis.  A famous special case is Andrew Wiles’s 1995 proof of Fermat’s last theorem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Geometric Langlands conjecture**   | The geometric version, developed by Vladimir Drinfeld in the 1980s, replaces number-theory objects with geometric ones.  It proposes a correspondence between: (1) **representations of the fundamental group** of a Riemann surface (ways loops can wind around surfaces such as spheres or doughnuts), and (2) **sheaves**, algebraic-geometry objects that assign vector spaces to points on a manifold.  Although both sides live in the same broad world of complex geometry, understanding their deep unity has been challenging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **How was it proved?**               | Work began in the 1990s when Alexander Beilinson and Drinfeld described how certain sheaves could bridge representations and sheaves; their 400‑page preprint was never formally published.  Gaitsgory and Dima Arinkin refined the relationship in 2012 and later Gaitsgory outlined a step‑by‑step proof.  The final proof required an international team and is widely regarded as a milestone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Why does it matter?**              | 1. **New research avenues:** The proof encourages exploration of *local* versions of the Langlands conjectures that focus on discs around points on a Riemann surface, rather than on the entire manifold.  Peter Scholze and Laurent Fargues built a “wormhole” linking local arithmetic and global geometric programmes, helping to tackle p‑adic versions of the arithmetic Langlands conjecture. 2. **Physics connections:** Edward Witten and Anton Kapustin showed that a symmetry (S‑duality) in certain four‑dimensional gauge theories has the same structure as the geometric Langlands correspondence.  This suggests that the Langlands programme is connected to deep symmetries in quantum field theory, and researchers like Minhyong Kim are turning quantum‑theory ideas into precise number‑theoretic analogues. |

**Summary**

Nature’s news feature reports that mathematicians have finally proved the geometric Langlands conjecture.  The result is a milestone in the Langlands programme, which aims to unify disparate branches of mathematics.  The proof connects representations of fundamental groups of Riemann surfaces with geometric sheaves and builds on decades of work by Drinfeld, Beilinson, Gaitsgory and others.  The breakthrough not only validates a key part of the Langlands vision but also opens up new research directions in both pure mathematics and theoretical physics.

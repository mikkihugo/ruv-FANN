# Physics Connections to Geometric Langlands

## 1. The Kapustin-Witten Discovery

### 1.1 N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory

The connection between geometric Langlands and physics was discovered by Anton Kapustin and Edward Witten in their groundbreaking 2007 paper. They showed that the geometric Langlands correspondence emerges naturally from a twisted version of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions.

#### The N=4 SYM Theory
- **Field Content**: 
  - Gauge field A_μ
  - Six scalar fields φ^I (I=1,...,6)
  - Four Weyl fermions ψ^α
- **Symmetries**:
  - SU(4) R-symmetry
  - Conformal symmetry
  - S-duality: g → 1/g, θ → -1/θ

#### The Twist
Kapustin-Witten apply a topological twist that breaks:
```
SO(4) × SU(4)_R → SO(2) × SO(2) × SU(2) × SU(2)
```

This produces a 4D topological quantum field theory (TQFT) whose observables are independent of the metric.

### 1.2 S-Duality and Langlands

#### Electric-Magnetic Duality
The S-duality of N=4 SYM exchanges:
- **Coupling**: g ↔ 1/g
- **Theta angle**: θ ↔ -θ/2π
- **Gauge group**: G ↔ ^L G (Langlands dual)

This is a quantum generalization of classical electromagnetic duality:
```
E → B,  B → -E
electric charges ↔ magnetic monopoles
```

#### Mathematical Correspondence
Under S-duality:
- **Electric Wilson lines** → **Magnetic 't Hooft lines**
- **G-bundles** → **^L G local systems**
- **D-modules** → **Coherent sheaves**

This precisely matches the geometric Langlands correspondence!

### 1.3 Dimensional Reduction

Starting with 4D N=4 SYM on M₄ = C × Σ:
1. **Compactify on C**: Get 2D sigma model with target Hitchin space
2. **Topological twist**: Produces A-model or B-model
3. **S-duality**: Exchanges A-model and B-model

The result is that geometric Langlands emerges as the statement of S-duality after compactification.

## 2. The Hitchin System

### 2.1 Higgs Bundles and Integrable Systems

#### Definition
A Higgs bundle is a pair (E, φ) where:
- E is a holomorphic vector bundle on curve C
- φ ∈ H⁰(C, End(E) ⊗ K_C) is the Higgs field

#### Hitchin Fibration
```
h: M_Higgs → B
(E, φ) ↦ characteristic polynomial of φ
```

This makes M_Higgs into a completely integrable system.

#### BPS Equations
The Hitchin equations (dimensionally reduced from self-duality):
```
F_A + [φ, φ*] = 0
∂̄_A φ = 0
```

These are the BPS (Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfeld) equations for the theory.

### 2.2 Spectral Curves and Duality

#### Spectral Data
For each Higgs bundle (E, φ):
- **Spectral curve** S ⊂ T*C defined by det(λ - φ) = 0
- **Line bundle** L on S (eigenline bundle)

#### SYZ Mirror Symmetry
The Hitchin system exhibits SYZ (Strominger-Yau-Zaslow) mirror symmetry:
- **A-side**: Lagrangian torus fibers (flat connections)
- **B-side**: Complex torus fibers (spectral curves)
- **T-duality**: Exchanges the two pictures

This is a geometric realization of S-duality!

### 2.3 Quantum Hitchin System

#### Quantization
The classical Hitchin system can be quantized:
- **Phase space**: T*Bun_G ≃ M_Higgs
- **Quantization**: D-modules on Bun_G
- **Quantum Hamiltonians**: Hitchin Hamiltonians

#### Geometric Quantization
```
Classical: {f, g} = ω(X_f, X_g)
Quantum: [f̂, ĝ] = iℏ{f, g}
```

The quantum Hitchin Hamiltonians are the quantum versions of the classical integrals.

## 3. Gauge Theory Aspects

### 3.1 Wilson and 't Hooft Lines

#### Wilson Lines
For a representation R of G:
```
W_R(C) = Tr_R P exp(∮_C A)
```

These create electric charges and measure holonomy of connections.

#### 't Hooft Lines
Dual magnetic operators creating magnetic monopoles:
```
T_R(C) = magnetic disorder operator
```

Under S-duality: W_R^G ↔ T_R^{^L G}

#### Line Operators in Langlands
- **Automorphic side**: Wilson lines → Hecke operators
- **Spectral side**: 't Hooft lines → multiplication operators
- **S-duality**: Explains Hecke eigenproperty

### 3.2 Branes and Boundary Conditions

#### A-branes and B-branes
In the sigma model with target M_Higgs:
- **A-branes**: Lagrangian submanifolds with flat connections
- **B-branes**: Holomorphic submanifolds with holomorphic bundles

#### Canonical Branes
- **Brane_cc**: Canonical coisotropic brane on Bun_G
- **Brane_0**: Zero-section brane on Loc_{^L G}

The functor Hom(Brane_cc, -) implements the Langlands correspondence.

#### Boundary Conditions
Different boundary conditions in 4D theory produce:
- **Dirichlet**: D-modules
- **Neumann**: Coherent sheaves
- S-duality exchanges these boundary conditions

### 3.3 Chern-Simons Theory

#### 3D Chern-Simons
Reducing N=4 SYM to 3D gives Chern-Simons theory:
```
S_CS = (k/4π) ∫ Tr(A ∧ dA + (2/3)A ∧ A ∧ A)
```

#### Analytic Continuation
Complex Chern-Simons theory connects:
- **Real slice**: Compact gauge group, unitary representations
- **Complex slice**: Complex gauge group, holomorphic bundles

This explains the relationship between:
- Betti version (representations of π₁)
- de Rham version (connections)

## 4. String Theory Connections

### 4.1 Type IIB String Theory

#### Geometric Engineering
The 4D N=4 SYM arises from Type IIB string theory:
- **D3-branes**: Wrapped on C × ℝ²
- **Background**: Calabi-Yau 3-fold
- **S-duality**: Fundamental symmetry of Type IIB

#### F-theory Perspective
In F-theory on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau:
- **Base**: C × ℝ²
- **Fiber**: Elliptic curve τ
- **S-duality**: Modular transformation on τ

### 4.2 D-branes and Sheaves

#### D-brane Categories
- **B-type D-branes**: D^b(Coh(X))
- **A-type D-branes**: D^b(Fuk(X))

The geometric Langlands correspondence becomes a statement about D-brane categories.

#### Derived Categories
The appearance of derived categories in Langlands is explained by:
- D-branes form triangulated categories
- Morphisms are open string states
- Derived functors arise naturally

### 4.3 M-theory and Duality

#### M-theory Lift
Lifting to M-theory on G₂ manifolds:
- **M5-branes**: Wrapped on associative 3-cycles
- **Geometric Langlands**: Arises from M5-brane dynamics
- **Electric-magnetic duality**: Geometric in M-theory

#### AGT Correspondence
Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa relate:
- 4D N=2 gauge theories
- 2D conformal field theories
- Instanton partition functions ↔ conformal blocks

This provides another physics perspective on Langlands-type dualities.

## 5. Quantum Field Theory Structures

### 5.1 Topological Field Theory

#### TQFT Structure
The Kapustin-Witten theory is a 4D TQFT with:
- **State spaces**: Vector spaces on 3-manifolds
- **Amplitudes**: Numbers on 4-manifolds
- **Functoriality**: Gluing = composition

#### Observables
- **Local operators**: Create defects
- **Line operators**: Wilson/'t Hooft lines
- **Surface operators**: Codimension-2 defects

### 5.2 Supersymmetry

#### Topological Supercharges
The twist produces nilpotent supercharges:
```
Q² = 0,  {Q, Q†} = 0
```

#### BPS States
Physical states satisfy:
```
Q|ψ⟩ = 0
```
These are the topological observables.

#### Index Theory
Supersymmetric indices count BPS states:
```
I = Tr(-1)^F e^{-βH}
```
These connect to mathematical invariants.

### 5.3 Anomalies and Consistency

#### Gauge Anomalies
Consistency requires:
- Anomaly cancellation
- Proper regularization
- S-duality preservation

#### Gravitational Anomalies
The theory must be consistent on curved backgrounds:
- Gravitational anomaly → central charge
- Connects to index theorems
- Explains appearance of Todd classes
